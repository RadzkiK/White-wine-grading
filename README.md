# White-wine-grading in Polish
Final project for Data Mining class. The work involved creating a model to predict the quality of wine

For the given data regarding white wine, an exploratory data analysis was carried out and models for predicting wine quality were created. A classification model was created using the XGBoost algorithm and a regression model using the MLP algorithm. An attempt was made to group and characterize the resulting groups, but unfortunately it did not end positively.

Project consist a python file with a coding part involved, and a PDF file where the report presents the results of the work.
